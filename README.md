# Concordancing
Following Roger Bilisoly, *Practical text mining with Perl*. I'm not an expert Perl programmer at all, so, this source fix a little mistakes made by me. If you found a \<FILE\> chunk error or Use of uninitialized value, hope you can overcome them with this list.

On Chapter 6, concordance.pl is showed as Program 6.1 Core concordance code for use with code samples 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9 and 6.10.

For my own purposes, using here a text file -in Spanish- obtained via Blogger API 3.0, but you may choose another file/language. 

Finally, if you don't want touch your Perl system, install perlbrew.
